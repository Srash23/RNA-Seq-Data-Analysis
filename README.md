ii. Differential Expression Analysis (DEA)

iii. Statistical comparison using log2 fold change and adjusted p-values.

**3. Gene Ontology (GO) & Pathway Analysis**

i. Identify enriched pathways using KEGG and GO terms.

**4. Data Visualization**

i. Generate plots such as:

ii. Volcano Plot (Significant genes based on log2 fold change)

iii. Heatmap (Cluster expression profiles)

iv. PCA Plot (Principal component analysis for sample variation)

## Results & Findings
